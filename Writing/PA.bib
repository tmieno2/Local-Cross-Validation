  abstract = {{Flexible estimation of heterogeneous treatment effects lies at the heart of many statistical applications, such as personalized medicine and optimal resource allocation. In this article we develop a general class of two-step algorithms for heterogeneous treatment effect estimation in observational studies. First, we estimate marginal effects and treatment propensities to form an objective function that isolates the causal component of the signal. Then, we optimize this data-adaptive objective function. The proposed approach has several advantages over existing methods. From a practical perspective, our method is flexible and easy to use: in both steps, any loss-minimization method can be employed, such as penalized regression, deep neural networks, or boosting; moreover, these methods can be fine-tuned by cross-validation. Meanwhile, in the case of penalized kernel regression, we show that our method has a quasi-oracle property. Even when the pilot estimates for marginal effects and treatment propensities are not particularly accurate, we achieve the same error bounds as an oracle with prior knowledge of these two nuisance components. We implement variants of our approach based on penalized regression, kernel ridge regression, and boosting in a variety of simulation set-ups, and observe promising performance relative to existing baselines.}},

With the satellite positioning system and electronic communication standards. position and time may be integrated into all procedures connected to farming. Today, precision farming is primarily geared towards site-specific application of fertilisers with the resulting cost advantages being quite small.

  abstract = {The spatial variation of productivity across farm fields can be classified by delineating site-specific management zones. Since productivity is influenced by soil characteristics, the spatial pattern of productivity could be caused by a corresponding variation in certain soil properties. Determining the source of variation in productivity can help achieve more effective site-specific management. The objectives of this study were (i) to characterize the spatial variability of soil physical properties across irrigated corn (Zea Mays L.) production fields and (ii) to determine if soil physical properties could explain the variability in productivity between site-specific management zones. The study was conducted over three study sites in northeastern Colorado. The soil properties measured were bulk density, cone index, surface soil color, organic C, texture, sorptivity, and surface water content. A multi-response permutation procedure was used to test for significant differences among soil properties between management zones. Box plots of soil physical properties were created for each management zone within each study site to determine if trends in soil physical properties corresponded to the productivity potential of the management zones. Overall, this study showed that soil physical properties exhibited significant spatial variability across production fields. The trends observed for the measured soil physical properties corresponded to the productivity potential of the management zones. Utilizing site-specific management zones could help manage the in-field variability of yield-limiting soil physical properties. {\textcopyright} Soil Science Society of America.},

  abstract  = {Crop canopy sensor based in-season site-specific nitrogen (N) management is a promising approach to precision N management. GreenSeeker sensor has previously been evaluated in North China Plain (NCP) for improving winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) N management. The Crop Circle ACS-470 is an active canopy sensor with three user-configurable wavebands. This study identified important vegetation indices that can be calculated from Crop Circle green, red edge and near infrared (NIR) wavebands for estimating winter wheat N status and evaluated their potential improvements over GreenSeeker normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and ratio vegetation index (RVI). Six field experiments involving different N rates and varieties were conducted in the Quzhou Experiment Station of the China Agricultural University from 2009 to 2012. The results indicated that best Crop Circle ACS-470 sensor vegetation indices could explain similar amounts of aboveground biomass variability in comparison with GreenSeeker sensor NDVI, but Crop Circle normalized difference red edge/green optimized soil adjusted vegetation index (NDRE/GOSAVI) and red edge chlorophyll index (CIRE) were more sensitive to aboveground biomass (having lower noise equivalent) than GreenSeeker NDVI before and after biomass reached about 5000kgha-1, respectively. The Crop Circle green difference vegetation index (GDVI) (R2=0.60) and chlorophyll index (CIG) (R2=0.89) explained 53{\%} and 7-11{\%} more variability in plant N concentration and uptake than GreenSeeker indices, respectively. The Crop Circle green re-normalized difference vegetation index (GRDVI) (R2=0.78) and modified green soil adjusted vegetation index (MGSAVI) (R2=0.77) performed consistently better than GreenSeeker NDVI (R2=0.47) and RVI (R2=0.44) for estimating N nutrition index (NNI). We conclude that the three band user configurable Crop Circle ACS-470 sensor can improve the estimation of winter wheat N status as compared with two fixed band GreenSeeker sensor.},

  abstract = {Remote sensing techniques offer a unique solution for mapping stress and monitoring its time-course. This article reviews the main issues to be addressed for quantifying stress level from remote sensing observations, and to mitigate its impact on crop production by managing cultural practices. The case of nitrogen fertilization is used here as a paradigm. The derivation of canopy state variables such as the leaf area index (LAI) and chlorophyll content (Cab) is first addressed. It is demonstrated that the inversion of radiative transfer models leads to useful estimates of these variables. However, because of the ill-posed nature of the inverse problem, better accuracy is achieved when using prior information on the distribution of the variables and when multiplying LAI by Cab to get canopy level chlorophyll content. This variable, LAI×Cab is well suited for quantifying canopy level nitrogen content. It is used for nitrogen stress evaluation by comparison with a reference unstressed situation which is, however, not easy to get in practice. The combination of remote sensing observations with crop models provides an elegant solution for stress quantification through assimilation approaches. It fuses several sources of information within our knowledge of the processes involved and accounts for the environmental budget which can be integrated when making decisions about cultural practices. Conclusions are drawn on the issues related to the retrieval of canopy state variables from remote sensing data, to the link between these observables and crop models, and to the assimilation approaches. Avenues for further research are finally discussed along with the required observation system. {\textcopyright} The Author [2006].

  abstract  = {Non-destructive and quick assessment of leaf nitrogen (N) status is important for dynamic management of nitrogen nutrition and productivity forecast in crop production. This research was undertaken to make a systematic analysis on the quantitative relationship of leaf nitrogen concentrations (LNCs) to different hyperspectral vegetation indices with multiple field experiments under varied nitrogen rates and varied types in rice (Oryza sativa L.). The results showed that some published indices had good relations with LNC such as two-band indices, R750/R710 (ZM), Gitelson and Merzlyak index two (GM-2), R735/R720 (RI-1dB), R738/R720 (RI-2dB) and the normalized difference red edge index (NDRE), three-band indices, adjusted normalized index 705 (mND705), physiological reflectance index c (PRIc), terrestrial chlorophyll index (MTCI), and red edge position derived with four point linear interpolation (REP{\_}LI). Three-band indices performed better than two-band indices, with MTCI exhibiting the best logarithmic relation to LNC in rice. Then, hyper-spectral vegetation indices computed with random two bands ($\lambda$1 and $\lambda$2) from 400 to 2500nm range were related to LNC of rice. The results indicated that two-band indices combined with bands of 550-600nm and 500-550nm in green region had good relationships with LNC, and simple ratio index SR(533,565) performed the best in all two-band indices, similar to the published three-band indices (mND705, PRIc and MTCI). New three-band indices R434/(R496+R401) and R705/(R717+R491) were proposed for prediction of LNC with improved ability over the SR(533,565) and published spectral indices. Moreover, R705/(R717+R491) performed well in all the data from ground spectra, modeled AVIRIS and Hyperion spectra, and acquired Hyperion image hyperspectra. The R434/(R496+R401) also exhibited well in both ground and modeled AVIRIS and Hyperion image spectra, but could not be tested with the acquired Hyperion image because of the absence in radiometric calibration of the bands less than 416nm. Overall, the newly developed three-band spectral index R705/(R717+R491) should be a good indicator of LNC at ground and space scales in rice. Yet, these new indices still need to be tested with more remote sensors based on ground, airborne and spaceborne, and verified widely in other ecological locations involving different cultivars and production systems. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

Machine learning (ML), with its predictive power to tackle complex systems, may solve this barrier in the development of locally based N recommendations. The objective of this study was to explore application of ML methodologies to predict economic optimum nitrogen rate (EONR) for corn using data from 47 experiments across the US Corn Belt. Two features, a water table adjusted available water capacity (AWCwt) and a ratio of in-season rainfall to AWCwt (R AWCwt), were created to capture the impact of soil hydrology on N dynamics. Four ML mod-els—linear regression (LR), ridge regression (RR), least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression, and gradient boost regression trees (GBRT)—were assessed and validated using “leave-one-location-out” (LOLO) and “leave-one-year-out” (LOYO) approaches. Generally, RR outperformed other models in predicting both at planting and split EONR times. Among the 47 tested sites, for 33 sites the predicted split EONR using RR fell within the 95{\%} confidence interval, suggesting the chance of using the RR model to make an acceptable prediction of split EONR is {\~{}}70{\%}. When RR was used to test split EONR prediction with input weather features surrogated with 10 yr of historical weather data, the model demonstrated robustness (MAE, 33.6 kg ha–1; R2 = 0.46). Incorporating mechanistically derived hydrological features significantly enhanced the ability of the ML procedures to model EONR. Improvement in estimating in-season soil hydrological status seems essential for success in modeling N demand.},

  abstract  = {In this article, we propose using the principle of boosting to reduce the bias of a random forest prediction in the regression setting. From the original random forest fit, we extract the residuals and then fit another random forest to these residuals. We call the sum of these two random forests a one-step boosted forest. We show with simulated and real data that the one-step boosted forest has a reduced bias compared to the original random forest. The article also provides a variance estimate of the one-step boosted forest by an extension of the infinitesimal Jackknife estimator. Using this variance estimate, we can construct prediction intervals for the boosted forest and we show that they have good coverage probabilities. Combining the bias reduction and the variance estimate, we show that the one-step boosted forest has a significant reduction in predictive mean squared error and thus an improvement in predictive performance. When applied on datasets from the UCI database, one-step boosted forest performs better than random forest and gradient boosting machine algorithms. Theoretically, we can also extend such a boosting process to more than one step and the same principles outlined in this article can be used to find variance estimates for such predictors. Such boosting will reduce bias even further but it risks over-fitting and also increases the computational burden. Supplementary materials for this article are available online.},

  abstract  = {Active canopy sensor (ACS)—based precision nitrogen (N) management (PNM) is a promising strategy to improve crop N use efficiency (NUE). The GreenSeeker (GS) sensor with two fixed bands has been applied to improve winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) N management in North China Plain (NCP). The Crop Circle (CC) ACS-470 active sensor is user configurable with three wavebands. The objective of this study was to develop a CC ACS-470 sensor-based PNM strategy for winter wheat in NCP and compare it with GS sensor-based N management strategy, soil Nmin test-based in-season N management strategy and conventional farmer's practice. Four site-years of field N rate experiments were conducted from 2009 to 2013 to identify optimum CC vegetation indices for estimating early season winter wheat plant N uptake (PNU) and grain yield in Quzhou Experiment Station of China Agricultural University located in Hebei province of NCP. Another nine on-farm experiments were conducted at three different villages in Quzhou County in 2012/2013 to evaluate the performance of the developed N management strategy. The results indicated that the CC ACS-470 sensor could significantly improve estimation of early season PNU (R2 = 0.78) and grain yield (R2 = 0.62) of winter wheat over GS sensor (R2 = 0.60 and 0.33, respectively). All three in-season N management strategies achieved similar grain yield as compared with farmer's practice. The three PNM strategies all significantly reduced N application rates and increased N partial factor productivity (PFP) by an average of 61–67 {\%}. It is concluded that the CC sensor can improve estimation of early season winter wheat PNU and grain yield as compared to the GS sensor, but the PNM strategies based on these two sensors perform equally well for improving winter wheat NUE in NCP. More studies are needed to further develop and evaluate these active sensor-based PNM strategies under more diverse on-farm conditions.},

In this article, we develop a nonparametric causal forest for estimating heterogeneous treatment effects that extends Breiman's widely used random forest algorithm. In the potential outcomes framework with unconfoundedness, we show that causal forests are pointwise consistent for the true treatment effect and have an asymptotically Gaussian and centered sampling distribution. We also discuss a practical method for constructing asymptotic confidence intervals for the true treatment effect that are centered at the causal forest estimates. Our theoretical results rely on a generic Gaussian theory for a large family of random forest algorithms. To our knowledge, this is the first set of results that allows any type of random forest, including classification and regression forests, to be used for provably valid statistical inference. In experiments, we find causal forests to be substantially more powerful than classical methods based on nearest-neighbor matching, especially in the presence of irrelevant covariates.},

  abstract  = {Accurate yield estimation and optimised nitrogen management is essential in agriculture. Remote sensing (RS) systems are being more widely used in building decision support tools for contemporary farming systems to improve yield production and nitrogen management while reducing operating costs and environmental impact. However, RS based approaches require processing of enormous amounts of remotely sensed data from different platforms and, therefore, greater attention is currently being devoted to machine learning (ML) methods. This is due to the capability of machine learning based systems to process a large number of inputs and handle non-linear tasks. This paper discusses research developments conducted within the last 15 years on machine learning based techniques for accurate crop yield prediction and nitrogen status estimation. The paper concludes that the rapid advances in sensing technologies and ML techniques will provide cost-effective and comprehensive solutions for better crop and environment state estimation and decision making. More targeted application of the sensor platforms and ML techniques, the fusion of different sensor modalities and expert knowledge, and the development of hybrid systems combining different ML and signal processing techniques are all likely to be part of precision agriculture (PA) in the near future.},

The objective of this paper is to demonstrate how high-resolution satellite and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) images can be used to assess the spatial variability of yield, and yield response to fertilizer. The study included 48 and 50 smallholder fields monitored during the 2014 and 2015 cropping seasons south-east of Koutiala (Mali), cropped with the five major crops grown in the area (cotton, maize, sorghum, millet and peanuts). Each field included up to five plots with different fertilizer applications and one plot with farmer practice. Fortnightly, in-situ in each field data were collected synchronous with UAV imaging using a Canon S110 NIR camera. A concurrent series of very high-resolution satellite images was procured and these images were used to mask out trees. For each plot, we calculated vegetation index means, medians and coefficients of variation. Cross-validated general linear models were used to assess the predictability of relative differences in crop yield and yield response to fertilizer, explicitly accounting for the effects of fertility treatments, between-field and within-field variabilities. Differences between fields accounted for a much larger component of variation than differences between fertilization treatments. Vegetation indices from UAV images strongly related to ground cover (R2 = 0.85), light interception (R2 = 0.79) and vegetation indices derived from satellite images (R2 values of about 0.8). Within-plot distributions of UAV-derived vegetation index values were negatively skewed, and within-plot variability of vegetation index values was negatively correlated with yield. Plots on shallow soils with poor growing conditions showed the largest within-plot variability. GLM models including UAV derived estimates of light interception explained up to 78{\%} of the variation in crop yield and 74{\%} of the variation in fertilizer response within a single field. These numbers dropped to about 45{\%} of the variation in yield and about 48{\%} of the variation in fertilizer response when lumping all fields of a given crop, with Q2 values of respectively 22 and 40{\%} respectively when tested with a leave-field-out procedure. This indicates that remotely sensed imagery doesn't fully capture the influence of crop stress and management. Assessment of crop fertilizer responses with vegetation indices therefore needs a reference under similar management. Spatial variability in UAV-derived vegetation index values at the plot scale was significantly related to differences in yields and fertilizer responses. The strong relationships between light interception and ground cover indicate that combining vertical photographs or high-resolution remotely sensed vegetation indices with crop growth models allows to explicitly account for the spatial variability and will improve the accuracy of yield and crop production assessments, especially in heterogeneous smallholder conditions.},

The canopy spectral reflectance of rice grown with different levels of nitrogen inputs was determined at several important growth stages. This study was conducted at the experiment farm of Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China. The soil plant analysis development (SPAD) value was used as a reference data that indirectly reflects nitrogen status in rice. A total of 64 rice samples were used for Vis/NIR spectroscopy at 325-1075 nm using a field spectroradiometer, and chemometrics of partial least square (PLS) was used for regression. The correlation coefficient (r), root mean square error of prediction, and bias in prediction set by PLS were, respectively, 0. 8545, 0. 7628, and 0. 0521 for SPAD value prediction in tillering stage, 0. 9082, 0. 4452, and -0. 0109 in booting stage, and 0. 8632, 0. 7469, and 0. 0324 in heading stage. Least squares support vector machine (LS-SVM) model was compared with PLS and back propagation neural network methods. The results showed that LS-SVM was superior to the conventional linear and non-linear methods in predicting SPAD values of rice. Independent component analysis was executed to select several sensitive wavelengths (SWs) based on loading weights; the optimal LS-SVM model was achieved with SWs of 560, 575-580, 700, 730, and 740 nm for SPAD value prediction in booting stage.

  abstract = {Nitrogen (N) fertilization for cereal crop production does not follow any kind of generalized methodology that guarantees maximum nitrogen use efficiency (NUE). The objective of this work was to amalgamate some of the current concepts for N management in cereal production into an applied algorithm. This work at Oklahoma State University from 1992 to present has focused primarily on the use of optical sensors in red and near infrared bands for predicting yield, and using that information in an algorithm to estimate fertilizer requirements. The current algorithm, "WheatN.1.0," may be separated into several discreet components: 1) mid-season prediction of grain yield, determined by dividing the normalized difference vegetative index (NDVI) by the number of days from planting to sensing (estimate of biomass produced per day on the specific date when sensor readings are collected); 2) estimating temporally dependent responsiveness to applied N by placing non-N-limiting strips in production fields each year, and comparing these to the farmer practice (response index); and 3) determining the spatial variability within each 0.4 m2 area using the coefficient of variation (CV) from NDVI readings. These components are then integrated into a functional algorithm to estimate application rate whereby N removal is estimated based on the predicted yield potential for each 0.4 m2 area and adjusted for the seasonally dependent responsiveness to applied N. This work shows that yield potential prediction equations for winter wheat can be reliably established with only 2 years of field data. Furthermore, basing mid-season N fertilizer rates on predicted yield potential and a response index can increase NUE by over 15{\%} in winter wheat when compared to conventional methods. Using our optical sensor-based algorithm that employs yield prediction and N responsiveness by location (0.4 m2 resolution) can increase yields and decrease environmental contamination due to excessive N fertilization.

  abstract = {Wheat grain protein content (GPC) is a key component when evaluating wheat nutrition. It is also important to determine wheat GPC before harvest for agricultural and food process enterprises in order to optimize the wheat grading process. Wheat GPC across a field is spatially variable due to the inherent variability of soil properties and position in the landscape. The objectives of this field study were: (i) to assess the spatial and temporal variability of wheat nitrogen (N) attributes related to the grain quality of winter wheat production through canopy fluorescence sensor measurements; and (ii) to examine the influence of spatial variability of soil N and moisture across different growth stages on the wheat grain quality. A geostatistical approach was used to analyze data collected from 110 georeferenced locations. In particular, Ordinary Kriging Analysis (OKA) was used to produce maps of wheat GPC, GPC yield, and wheat canopy fluorescence parameters, including simple florescence ratio and Nitrogen Balance Indices (NBI). Soil Nitrate-Nitrogen (NO3-N) content and soil Time Domain Reflectometry (TDR) value in the study field were also interpolated through the OKA method. The fluorescence parameter maps, soil NO3-N and soil TDR maps obtained from the OKA output were compared with the wheat GPC and GPC yield maps in order to assess their relationships. The results of this study indicate that the NBI spatial variability map in the late stage of wheat growth can be used to distinguish areas that produce higher GPC.},

  abstract = {Current methods of determining nitrogen (N) fertilization rates in winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) are based on farmer projected yield goals and fixed N removal rates per unit of grain produced. This work reports on an alternative method of determining fertilizer N rates using estimates of early-season plant N uptake and potential yield determined from in-season spectral measurements collected between January and April. Reflectance measurements under daytime lighting in the red and near infrared regions of the spectra were used to compute the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). Using a modified daytime lighting reflectance sensor, early-season plant N uptake between Feekes physiological growth stages 4 (leaf sheaths lengthen) through 6 (first node of stem visible) was found to be highly correlated with NDVI. Further analyses showed that dividing the NDVI sensor measurements between Feekes growth stages 4 and 6, by the days from planting to sensing date was highly correlated with final grain yield. This in-season estimate of yield (INSEY) was subsequently used to compute the potential N that could be removed in the grain. In-season N fertilization needs were then considered to be equal to the amount of predicted grain N uptake (potential yield times grain N) minus predicted early-season plant N uptake (at the time of sensing), divided by an efficiency factor of 0.70. This method of determining in-season fertilizer need has been shown to decrease large area N rates while also increasing wheat grain yields when each 1 m2 area was sensed and treated independently.},

However, an evaluation of analytical methods is needed to determine the success of incorporating this information. The objectives of this research were to evaluate statistical and machine learning (ML) algorithms for utilizing soil and weather information for improving corn N recommendation tools. Eight algorithms [stepwise, ridge regression, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (Lasso), elastic net regression, principal component regression (PCR), partial least squares regression (PLSR), decision tree, and random forest] were evaluated using a dataset containing measured soil and weather variables from a regional database. The performance was evaluated based on how well these algorithms predicted corn economically optimal N rates (EONR) from 49 sites in the U.S. Midwest. Multiple algorithm modeling scenarios were examined with and without adjustment for multicollinearity and inclusion of two-way interaction terms to identify the soil and weather variables that could improve three dissimilar N recommendation tools. Results showed the out-of-sample root-mean-square error (RMSE) for the decision tree and some random forest modeling scenarios were better than the stepwise or ridge regression, but not significantly different than any other algorithm. The best ML algorithm for adjusting N recommendation tools was the random forest approach (r2 increased between 0.72 and 0.84 and the RMSE decreased between 41 and 94 kg N ha−1). However, the ML algorithm that best adjusted tools while using a minimal amount of variables was the decision tree. This method was simple, needing only one or two variables (regardless of modeling scenario) and provided moderate improvement as r2 values increased between 0.15 and 0.51 and RMSE decreased between 16 and 66 kg N ha−1. Using ML algorithms to adjust N recommendation tools with soil and weather information shows promising results for better N management in the U.S. Midwest.},

On average, N fertilization significantly increased corn yield, protein content, and test weight, but decreased corn oil and starch content. The overall economically optimum nitrogen rate (EONR) was 125 kg ha-1, but EONR varied from 93 to 195 kg ha-1 in different environments. The N rates that would maximize protein content and test weight (MAXN) varied from 143 to 303 kg ha-1 and 0 to 235 kg ha-1 in different environments, respectively. Significant within-field variability in N response was detected in five of six environments for yield, but not in more than two environments for any quality parameter. Hybrid differences were significant in all six environments for test weight, followed by oil content (five), protein and starch content (four), and yield (three). Hybrid differences between 33G26 and 33J24 in test weight response to N were consistent across environments, showing the potential of hybrid-specific N management for this quality parameter. However, hybrid differences in yield and quality did not vary significantly over space in most environments, showing limited potential of within-field variable hybrid selection. Further studies involving more diverse within-field soil-landscape conditions and hybrids are needed. {\textcopyright} American Society of Agronomy.},

Many have formed doubts about this investment because of their inability to directly apply this information as feedback for improving management. The objective of this case-study analysis was to investigate how site-specific decisions can be improved by transforming a long-term multiple-crop yield-map dataset into profit maps that contain economic thresholds representing profitability zones. Ten years (1993-2002) of cleaned yield map data [4, 5, and 1 yr for corn (Zea mays L.), soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.], and grain sorghum (Sorghum bicolor L.), respectively] were collected for a 35.6-ha claypan-soil field in Missouri. Actual input costs and crop prices, published custom rates for field operations, and region-specific land rental prices were used to transform yield maps into profitability maps by year, by crop, and overall for 10 yr. Profit maps revealed large field areas where net profit was negative, largely due to negative profit from corn production on areas where topsoil was eroded. The areal extent and degree to which other unique field features affected profitability, such as a tree line and a drainage way, are discussed. This analysis demonstrates how changing yield into profitability metrics can help a producer consider and then decide on different management options. We explore how assessment and exploratory analysis with profitability mapping supports multiple aspects of the decision process, including identification, development, and selection. The decision process discussed supports a producer's need to manage fields with incomplete information and where satisficing rather than optimizing behavior often occurs. This analysis demonstrated how profit mapping can be of value for a producer and provides impetus for the precision agriculture community to consider profit mapping protocols and standards.

However, the nitrogen is not used efficiently, and wheat plants, for example, assimilated only 41{\%} of the nitrogen applied. This review confirms that the efficiency of fertiliser nitrogen can be improved through management practices which increase the crop's ability to compete with loss processes. However, the results of the review suggest that management practices alone will not prevent all losses (e.g. by denitrification), and it may be necessary to use enhanced efficiency fertilisers, such as controlled release products, and urease and nitrification inhibitors, to obtain a marked improvement in efficiency. Some of these products (e.g. nitrification inhibitors) when used in Australian agriculture have increased yield or reduced nitrogen loss in irrigated wheat, maize and cotton, and flooded rice, but most of the information concerning the use of enhanced efficiency fertilisers to reduce nitrogen loss to the environment has come from other countries. The potential role of enhanced efficiency fertilisers to increase yield in the various agricultural industries and prevent contamination of the environment in Australia is discussed. {\textcopyright} CSIRO 2008.},

  abstract = {Diagnosing nitrogen (N) sufficiency in crops is used to help insure more effective management of N fertilizer application, and several indicators have been proposed to this end. The N nutrition index (NNI) offers a reliable measurement, but it is relatively difficult to determine. This index is based on the relationship between plant tissue N concentration and the biomass of the plant's aerial parts. However, a good estimate of the NNI should be obtained by nondestructive methods that can be carried out quickly. Although dependent on sites, chlorophyll meter (CM) measurements have been correlated with the NNI in corn (Zea mays). Since chlorophyll can be estimated through remote sensing, the possibility of quickly obtaining measurements for large surface areas points to practical applications for precision agriculture. When combined with the mapping of soil properties such as apparent electrical conductivity (EC), elevation and slope, such chlorophyll measurements make it possible to derive N fertilization recommendations by taking into account natural variations in the soil. Recently, an instrument called the Dualex (FORCE-A, Orsay, France) is marketed, which uses measurement methods based on the fluorescent properties of plant tissues. It is similar to the CM in terms of its operating principle but it measures polyphenolics (Phen), compounds that accumulate in the epidermis of leaves under N stress. Epidermal transmittance to ultraviolet light is assessed by the fluorescence excitation ratio F(ultraviolet)/F(REF), where F(ultraviolet) is the fluorescence excitation detected following ultraviolet excitation, and F(REF) is the fluorescence detected on excitation at a reference wavelength, not absorbed by the epidermis. Although the Dualex generally did not identify more differences among treatments than the CM in our studies on wheat (Triticum aestivum), corn, and broccoli (Brassica oleracea ssp. italica), combining the two measurements in a chlorophyll/Phen ratio improved the relationships with crop Nutrition status appreciably. This ratio can also be estimated by remote sensing techniques. The NNI on its own does not constitute an economically optimal recommendation for N fertilizer [economically optimal N rate (EONR)]. The EONR is the N rate at which profit is greatest. Work is currently being done to use overfertilized reference plots for this purpose and to permit an improved correlation between the indicator (NNI or chlorophyll) and EONR.},

  abstract = {Nitrogen (N) input is one of the most important factors in maximizing yields and economic returns to farmers. Of the essentials nutrients, N is required in large quantities, and it is the most mobile and dynamic nutrient in soil systems. It is well-documented that soil physical and chemical properties are spatially variable and affect N dynamics and the mechanisms for its losses. For example, N dynamics could vary from high denitrification N2 losses from ponded areas with low drainage to high NO3 leaching losses from coarse-gravelly areas of the field. Recent developments in new technologies are allowing us to identify, measure, and map these changes across the field. We found that N management using site-specific management zones (SSMZ) that account for soil variability and productivity provides the amounts of N needed to increase yields and maximize the agronomic use efficiency of the applied N. The SSMZ-based N application outperformed treatments that used yield-goal-based and uniform N application rates. Grid-based N application treatments performed as well as the SSMZ for yields but were more inefficient as far as the unit of yields produced by unit of N fertilizer applied. The SSMZ can be used to improve N management and use efficiency of the applied N to increase yields and reduce N losses to the environment.},

Nowadays, there is an urgent need to identify next-generation bio-physical variable retrieval algorithms that can be incorporated into an operational processing chain for hyperspectral satellite missions. We assessed six retrieval algorithms for estimating LNC from canopy reflectance of winter wheat in eight field experiments. These experiments represented variations in the N application rates, planting densities, ecological sites and cultivars and yielded a total of 821 samples from various places in Jiangsu, China over nine consecutive years. Based on the reflectance spectra and their first derivatives, six methods using different numbers of wavelengths were applied to construct predictive models for estimating wheat LNC, including continuum removal (CR), vegetation indices (VIs), stepwise multiple linear regression (SMLR), partial least squares regression (PLSR), artificial neural networks (ANNs), and support vector machines (SVMs). To assess the performance of these six methods, we provided a systematic evaluation of the estimation accuracies using the six metrics that were the coefficients of determination for the calibration (R2C) and validation (R2V) sets, the root mean square errors of prediction (RMSEP) for the calibration and validation sets, the ratio of prediction to deviation (RPD), the computational efficiency (CE) and the complexity level (CL). The following results were obtained: (1) For the VIs method, SAVI(R1200, R705) produced a more accurate estimation of the LNC than other indices, with R2C, R2V, RMSEP, RPD and CE values of 0.844, 0.795, 0.384, 2.005 and 0.10 min, respectively; (2) For the SMLR, PLSR, ANNs and SVMs methods, the SVMs using the first derivative canopy spectra (SVM-FDS) offered the best accuracy in terms of R2C, R2V, RMSEP, RPD, and CE, at 0.96, 0.78, 0.37, 2.02, and 21.17, respectively; (3) The PLSR-FDS, ANN-OS and SVM-FDS methods yield similar accuracies if the CE and CL are not considered, however, ANNs and SVMs performed better on calibration set than the validation set which indicate that we should take more caution with the two methods for over-fitting. Except PLS method, the performance for most methods did not enhance when the spectrum were operated by the first derivative. Moreover, the evaluation of the robustness demonstrates that SVM method may be better suited than the other methods to cope with potential confounding factors for most varieties, ecological site and growth stage; (4) The prediction accuracy was found to be higher when more wavelengths were used, though at the cost of a lower CE. The findings are of interest to the remote sensing community for the development of improved inversion schemes for hyperspectral applications concerning other types of vegetation. The examples provided in this paper may also serve to illustrate the advantages and shortcomings of empirical hyperspectral models for mapping important vegetation biophysical properties of other crops.},

  abstract = {Fertilizer N needs of corn (Zea mays L.) vary widely both among and within fields. Many states use yield goal to help determine differences in fertilizer N need, but some states have questioned yield goal - derived recommendations because of the poor correlation of yield with fertilizer N need. In this study, data from 298 previously reported experiments in five states (Illinois, Minnesota, Missouri, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin) were combined to evaluate fertilizer N response of corn. Corn grain yield at the economically optimum N rate (EONR) was positively but poorly correlated with EONR (r2 = 0.02). This was consistent with others who have observed that maximum or optimum economic yield is a poor predictor of EONR. Our analysis indicated N supplied by the soil and previous management reduced N need from that predicted by yield alone at most locations. Delta yield (grain yield at optimum N rate minus grain yield of the control) was a much better predictor of EONR at these same locations (r2 = 0.47). A theoretically derived equation based on the delta yield concept was similarly capable of predicting EONR for corn. These results indicate that fertilizer recommendation systems that rely solely on yield or ignore yield entirely are limited to explaining less than 50{\%} of the variation in EONR for corn. Farmers should be encouraged to monitor delta yield as a more effective indicator of EONR than actual yield. Greater understanding of the delta yield concept is needed before relying on it to predict fertilizer N requirements.},

The eight treatments from various combinations of fertilizers and M were check, N, NP, NPK, M, MN, MNP, and MNPK. Mean grain yield decreased in the order of MNPK ≥ MNP {\textgreater} NPK {\textgreater} MN {\textgreater} NP {\textgreater} M {\textgreater} N {\textgreater} check (i.e., 8.01, 8.00, 7.51, 7.28, 7.00, 5.50, 4.89, and 3.43 Mg ha-1, respectively). Yield response to applied N and P increased with time since yields in the check plots declined with time. Potassium fertilizer application provided no, slight, and dramatic increase in grain yield during the initial 6 yr, next 5 yr, and last 8 yr, respectively. Response of straw yield to fertilizers and M was similar to the grain yield. Mean HI increased with fertilizers in no-M treatments for both crops. Crude protein concentration and N uptake in grain and straw increased markedly with fertilizers, and M increased it further. Fertilizers (N, NP, and NPK) led to NO3-N accumulation in most subsoil layers. Combined applications of fertilizers and M reduced soil NO3-N accumulation in soil compared with fertilizers alone. In conclusion, the findings suggest that it is important to use balanced application of chemical fertilizers and M at proper rates in order to protect soil and underground water from potential NO3-N pollution while also sustaining high crop production.},

Of particular importance is the consideration of the large extent and the high dimensionality (spectral, temporal and spatial) of remote sensing data. Moreover, the launch of the Sentinel satellite family will increase the availability of data, especially in the temporal domain, at no cost to the users. To analyze these data and to extract relevant features, such as essential climate variables (ECV), specific methodologies need to be exploited. Among these, greater attention is devoted to machine learning methods due to their flexibility and the capability to process large number of inputs and to handle non-linear problems. The main objective of this paper is to provide a review of research that is being carried out to retrieve two critically important terrestrial biophysical quantities (vegetation biomass and soil moisture) from remote sensing data using machine learning methods.},

  abstract = {The concentrations of various foliar chemicals can be estimated by analyzing the spectral reflectance of dried ground leaves. The continuum-removal analysis of Kokaly and Clark [Remote Sens. Environ. 67 (1999) 267] has been an improvement on the standard derivative analysis in such applications. Continuum-removal analysis enables the isolation of absorption features of interest, thus increasing the coefficients of determination and facilitating the identification of more sensible absorption features. The purpose of this study was to test Kokaly and Clark's methodology with aircraft-acquired hyperspectral data of eucalypt tree canopies, which are more complex than are spectra from many coniferous canopies and much more complex than the spectra from dried ground leaves. The results of the continuum-removal analysis were most encouraging. It identified, in one experiment or another, almost all of the known nitrogen absorption features. The coefficient of determination in one case increased from 0.65, using the standard derivative analysis, to 0.85 with the continuum-removal analysis. It is recommended that continuum-removal analysis become at least a supplement to standard derivative analysis in estimating foliar biochemical concentrations from remote sensing data. This study also reports several other findings: (1) the neural network method generally achieved higher coefficients of determination and lower errors of estimation [root mean square error (RMSE) and standard error of cross validation (SECV)] than did the modified partial least squares (PLS) or stepwise regression methods, probably indicating nonlinear relationships between biochemical concentrations and canopy reflectance; (2) modified partial least squares (MPLS) proved a better statistical method than conventional stepwise regression analysis in many cases in terms of both coefficient of determination and RMSE; and (3) the maximum spectrum of a cluster of tree pixels represents canopy reflectance at least as well as the mean spectrum of the cluster, especially when used in conjunction with the modified partial least squares method. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Inc.

  abstract = {This paper presents a method for mapping the nitrogen (N) status in a maize field using hyperspectral remote sensing imagery. An airborne survey was conducted with an AISA Eagle hyperspectral sensor over an experimental farm where maize (Zea mays L.) was grown with two N fertilization levels (0 and 100 kg N ha-1) in four replicates. Leaf and canopy field data were collected during the flight. The nitrogen (N) status has been estimated in this work based on the Nitrogen Nutrition Index (NNI), defined as the ratio between the leaf actual N concentration ({\%}Na) of the crop and the minimum N content required for the maximum biomass production (critical N concentration ({\%}Nc)) calculated through the dry mass at the time of the flight (Wflight). The inputs required to calculate the NNI (i.e., {\%}Na and Wflight) have been estimated through regression analyses between field data and remotely sensed vegetation indices. MCARI/MTVI2 (Modified Chlorophyll Absorption Ratio Index/Modified Triangular Vegetation Index 2) showed the best performances in estimating the {\%}Na (R2 = 0.59) and MTVI2 in estimating the Wflight (R2 = 0.80). The {\%}Na and the Wflight were then mapped and used to compute the NNI map over the entire field. The NNI map agreed with the NNI estimated using field data through traditional destructive measurements (R2 = 0.70) confirming the potential of using remotely sensed indices to assess the crop N condition. Finally, a method to derive a pixel based variable rate N fertilization map was proposed as the difference between the actual N content and the optimal N content. We think that the proposed operational methodology is promising for precision farming since it represents an innovative attempt to derive a variable rate N fertilization map based on the actual crop N status from an aerial hyperspectral image. {\textcopyright} 2014 by the authors.},

  abstract = {Nitrogen (N) is one of the most important limiting nutrients for sugarcane production. Conventionally, sugarcane N concentration is examined using direct methods such as collecting leaf samples from the field followed by analytical assays in the laboratory. These methods do not offer real-time, quick, and non-destructive strategies for estimating sugarcane N concentration. Methods that take advantage of remote sensing, particularly hyperspectral data, can present reliable techniques for predicting sugarcane leaf N concentration. Hyperspectral data are extremely large and of high dimensionality. Many hyperspectral features are redundant due to the strong correlation between wavebands that are adjacent. Hence, the analysis of hyperspectral data is complex and needs to be simplified by selecting the most relevant spectral features. The aim of this study was to explore the potential of a random forest (RF) regression algorithm for selecting spectral features in hyperspectral data necessary for predicting sugarcane leaf N concentration. To achieve this, two Hyperion images were captured from fields of 6–7 month-old sugarcane, variety N19. The machine-learning RF algorithm was used as a feature-selection and regression method to analyse the spectral data. Stepwise multiple linear (SML) regression was also examined to predict the concentration of sugarcane leaf N after the reduction of the redundancy in hyperspectral data. The results showed that sugarcane leaf N concentration can be predicted using both non-linear RF regression (coefficient of determination, R2 = 0.67; root mean square error of validation (RMSEV) = 0.15{\%}; 8.44{\%} of the mean) and SML regression models (R2 = 0.71; RMSEV = 0.19{\%}; 10.39{\%} of the mean) derived from the first-order derivative of reflectance. It was concluded that the RF regression algorithm has potential for predicting sugarcane leaf N concentration using hyperspectral data. {\textcopyright} 2013 Taylor and Francis.},

In this study, we evaluated the potential of hyperspectral indices obtained from field data and airborne imagery for developing N fertilizer recommendations in maize (Zea mays L.). Measurements were taken in a randomized field experiment with six N fertilizer rates ranging from zero to 200 kg{\textperiodcentered}N{\textperiodcentered}ha-1 and four replications on two different dates (before the second fertilizer application and at flowering) in 2012. Readings at ground level were taken with SPAD{\textregistered}, Dualex{\textregistered} and Multiplex{\textregistered} sensors, and airborne data were acquired by flying a hyperspectral and a thermal sensor 300 m over the experimental site. The hyperspectral imagery was used to calculate greenness, chlorophyll and photochemical indices for each plot. The Pearson coefficient was used to quantify the correlation between sensor readings and agronomic measurements. A statistical procedure based on the N-sufficient index was used to determine the accuracy of each index at distinguishing between N-deficient and N-sufficient plots. Indices based on airborne measurements were found to be as reliable as measurements taken with ground-level equipment at assessing crop N status and predicting yield at flowering. At stem elongation, the reflectance ratio, R750/R710, and fluorescence retrieval (SIF760) were the only indices that yielded significant results when compared to crop yield. Field-level SPAD readings, the airborne R750/R710 index and SIF760 had the lowest error rates when distinguishing N-sufficient from N-deficient treatments, but error reduction is still recommended before commercial field application. {\textcopyright} 2014 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

The objective of this paper is to review the state of SSM at the turn of the millennium and to offer some speculation as to its future course. The review is organized around the essential components of SSM listed above, i.e. measuring spatial variability, analyzing the data obtained from these measurements, using information gained from this analysis to effect changes in management practices, and determining whether the resulting benefits are worth the costs.

The present study was conducted to determine the quantitative relationships of leaf N concentration on a leaf dry weight basis (LNC) and leaf N accumulation per unit soil area (LNA) to ground-based canopy spectral reflectance in rice (Oryza sativa L.). Time-course measurements were taken on canopy spectral reflectance, LNC, and leaf dry weights, with 4 field experiments under different N application rates and rice cultivars across 4 growing seasons. All possible ratio vegetation indices (RVI), difference vegetation indices (DVI), and normalised difference vegetation indices (NDVI) of key wavebands from the MSR16 radiometer were calculated. The results showed that LNC, LNA, and canopy reflectance spectra all markedly varied with N rates, with consistent change patterns among different rice cultivars and experiment years. There were highly significant linear correlations between LNC and canopy reflectance in the visible region from 560 to 710 nm (|r| {\textgreater} 0.85), between LNA and canopy reflectance from 760 to 1100 nm (|r| {\textgreater} 0.79), and from 460 to 710 nm wavelengths (|r| {\textgreater} 0.70). Among all possible RVI, DVI, and NDVI of key wavebands from the MSR16 radiometer, NDVI of 1220 and 710 nm was most highly correlated to LNC, and RVI of 950 and 660 nm and RVI of 950 and 680 nm were the best spectral indices for quantitative monitoring of LNA in rice. The average relative root mean square errors (RRMSE) between the predicted LNC and LNA and the observed values with independent data were no more than 11{\%} and 25{\%}, respectively. These results indicated that the canopy spectral reflectance can be potentially used for non-destructive and real-time monitoring of leaf N status in rice. {\textcopyright} CSIRO 2007.},

  abstract = {The role of probabilistic methods in discrete mathematics cannot be overestimated. By defining the probability measure on a set of the studied combinatorial objects various numerical characteristics of these objects can be considered as random variables and studied using the methods of probability theory. The advantage of this approach is the well-developed probabilistic analytic techniques that allow us in many cases to obtain results, the proof of which by other methods appears too complicated, if indeed it is at all possible. The application of probabilistic methods is connected with extensive use of the terminology of probability theory. The reader will easily understand however that one speaks in fact about solving enumerative problems of discrete analysis. One of the primary research lines is the study of the limit properties of combinatorial objects manifested at the unlimited increase of the number of elements comprising such objects. It is often possible to represent the distributions of the characteristics of combinatorial objects as conditional distributions of the sums of independent random variables so that they can be studied using asymptotic methods in probability theory, namely limit theorems for sums of independent random variables.},

  abstract = {Understanding why farmers over-apply fertilizer is essential to designing effective agroenvironmental policy. If farmers are simply inefficient, possibilities exist for simultaneously improving farm profits and the environment. If not, costly trade-offs are necessary. This article examines why farmer perceptions of agronomic advice, input substitutability, hidden opportunity costs, uncertainty, and risk aversion can make it economically rational to "waste" fertilizer by applying it above agronomically recommended rates. I use this information to evaluate the relative merits of policy responses such as insurance, education, cost-shares, regulation, taxes, and land retirement.},

@article{Wang2021,
  abstract  = {Reliable and efficient in-season nitrogen (N) status diagnosis and recommendation methods are crucially important for the success of crop precision N management (PNM). The accuracy of these methods has been found to be influenced by soil properties, weather conditions, and crop management practices. It is important to effectively incorporate these variables to improve in-season N management. Machine learning (ML) methods are promising due to their capability of processing different types of data and modeling both linear and non-linear relationships. The objectives of this study were to (1) determine the potential improvement of in-season prediction of corn N nutrition index (NNI) and grain yield by combining soil, weather and management data with active sensor data using random forest regression (RFR) as compared with Lasso linear regression (LR) using similar data and simple regression (SR) models only using crop sensor data; and (2) to develop a new in-season side-dress N fertilizer recommendation strategy at eighth to ninth leaf stage (V8-V9) of corn developement using the RFR model. Twelve site-year experiments examining corn N rates and planting densities were conducted in Northeast China. The GreenSeeker sensor data and corn NNI were collected at V8-V9 stage, and grain yield was determined at the harvest stage (R6). The soil information was obtained at planting and the weather data was measured throughout the growing season. The results indicated that corn NNI and grain yield were better predicted by combining soil, weather and management information with GreenSeeker sensor data using RFR model (R2 = 0.86 and 0.79) and LR model (R2 = 0.85 and 0.76) as compared with only using GreenSeeker sensor data (R2 = 0.66 and 0.62–63) based on the test dataset. An innovative in-season side-dress N recommendation strategy was developed using the RFR grain yield prediction model to simulate corn grain yield responses to a series of side-dress N rates at V8-V9 stage. Based on these response curves, site-, and year-specific optimum side-dress N rates can be determined. The scenario analysis results indicated that this RFR model-based in-season N recommendation strategy could recommend side-dress N rates similar to those based on measured agronomic optimum N rate (AONR) or economic optimum N rate (EONR), with root mean square error (RMSE) of 17 kg ha−1 and relative error (RE) of 14–15 {\%}. It is concluded that combining soil, weather and management information with crop sensor data using RFR can significantly improve both in-season corn NNI and grain yield prediction and N management, compared with the approach based only on crop sensor data. More studies are needed to further improve and evaluate this approach under diverse on-farm conditions.},

We then identify current limitations of the econometric and simulation model toolbox in applied economics and explore potential solutions afforded by ML. We dive into cases such as inflexible functional forms, unstructured data sources and large numbers of explanatory variables in both prediction and causal analysis, and highlight the challenges of complex simulation models. Finally, we argue that economists have a vital role in addressing the shortcomings of ML when used for quantitative economic analysis.},

These include supervised learning methods for regression and classification, unsupervised learning methods, as well as matrix completion methods. Finally, we highlight newly developed methods at the intersection of ML and econometrics, methods that typically perform better than either off-the-shelf ML or more traditional econometric methods when applied to particular classes of problems, problems that include causal inference for average treat- ment effects, optimal policy estimation, and estimation of the counterfactual effect of price changes in consumer choice models.},
