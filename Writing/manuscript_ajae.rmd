# Introduction
The presence of nitrogen is crucial for corn yield productivity (Bullock and Bollock, 1994), yet the dynamic nature and spatial variability of soil physical properties impose a major challenge to optimal nitrogen management. The difficulty mainly stems from the intricate biophysical interactions that affect soil nitrogen mineralization, crop absorption, and nitrogen loss; On top of this, the mechanisms of nitrogen transformation can vary significantly not just within fields, but also between fields, which further complicates the task (Ransom et al., 2020). To cope with this complexity, farmers often apply excess nitrogen fertilizer, which reduces profitability and lead to environmental destruction by increasing the risk of nitrogen loss (Ransom et al., 2020; Wen et al., 2022). However, by avoiding both over and under-application of nitrogen fertilizer, farmers can reduce their cost and mitigate the environmental consequences associated with nitrogen loss (Wen et al., 2022). By applying nutrients based on the specific needs of plants, there is a possibility of enhancing the profitability for producers. However, the difficulty lies in interpreting the spatial variation in fields to determine the optimal application rates that maximize profitability without excessive fertilization (Malzer., 1996). In conventional agriculture, the natural spatial variations within a field are disregarded, and the entire area is managed uniformly. Nevertheless, implementing uniformly spatial nitrogen management can result in economic and environmental inefficiencies (Fassa et al., 2022). Due to the spatial dependence of field characteristics, there is a variation in how crop yields respond to managed inputs across a field (Trevisan et al., 2021). Site specific management is a useful method for optimizing crop production by adjusting inputs based on the specific site characteristics with the aim of determining the appropriate N rate for each part of the field (Fassa et al., 2022). As an example, Malzer (1996) indicated that economic benefits of using N fertilizers differ significantly depending on the landscape. The possible financial gains from employing N management practices tailored to specific sites can range anywhere from $4 to $37 per acre. In this regard, on-farm precision experiments (OFPE) conducted on a large-scale can provide insight into how to effectively adjust input application rates based on spatial variability, ultimately leading to optimized outcomes (Trevisan et al., 2021).
Taking into account that the EONR for a specific field and year remains unknown at the point of nitrogen application, it is important to use nitrogen fertilizer recommendation tools that accurately align with the optimal nitrogen rate. Yet determining the EONR for a specific field and year is not a straightforward process and requires a complex methodology including conducting on-farm research trials with candidate nitrogen rates and monitoring the corresponding yield responses. (Ransom et al., 2019). To estimate the site-specific economic optimum nitrogen rates that align with the actual EONRs for a particular field, a diverse range of tools and methodologies have been developed, among which we concentrate on the employment of machine learning techniques. Several studies (Wang et al., 2021; Du et al., 2022) have investigated the integration of soil and weather properties into machine learning techniques for predicting crop yield. The underlying premise is that incorporating diverse data sources, such as soil and weather information, can enhance the accuracy of yield prediction and subsequently improve the recommended nitrogen (N) rate. The authors of these studies often select the machine learning method based on its performance in predicting yield rather than its ability to estimate the economically optimal nitrogen rate. Other studies, such as the work by Correndo et al. (2021), centered on examining the impact of variable uncertainties in the algorithm; yet none of these studies have employed a methodology to identify the optimal model based on its performance for estimating the economic optimum nitrogen rate.
The selection of a model based solely on its yield prediction performance poses a significant challenge. The correlation between EONR and the corresponding yield at EONR is found to be inconclusive and of low magnitude. (Morris et al., 2018; Sawyer et al., 2006; Vanotti and Bundy, 1994). 
The precise estimation of EONR is intricately linked to the underlying nitrogen response in relation to crop yield, rather than relying solely on the accuracy of yield prediction. Stated differently, the accurate determination of EONR is contingent upon a comprehensive understanding of the causal impact of the treatment variable on crop yield, which provides the necessary information for precise EONR estimation. Building on the previous point, it is important to note that a model's effectiveness in predicting the yield level does not necessarily imply its suitability for estimating EONR. As a result, a model that exhibits high accuracy in yield level prediction may not necessarily be the most appropriate model for EONR estimation. 

Fertilizer recommendations have been primarily derived from field trials that assess how crops respond to different levels of fertilizer application. By collecting data from fertilizer studies, it becomes possible to fit the results to a variety of statistical models, then the most suitable model for a given cropping scenario will be chosen based on a thorough evaluation and selection process. As machine learning models are being increasingly utilized for model selection in the determination of the EONR, it is crucial that the selection process accurately mirrors the underlying method used to obtain EONR. Statistical inference and machine learning involve learning from data by fitting models to it. These models can be either parametric or nonparametric. However, if the model or method is not chosen appropriately, it can lead to inaccurate or misleading results. Therefore, selecting the right model or approach is crucial in obtaining reliable conclusions from the data which in turn leads us to an accurate EONR estimation. 
The primary aim of this study is to introduce a novel approach for model selection that is underpinned by causal relationships, in order to accurately estimate the economically optimal nitrogen rate via simulation. The proposed method hinges upon the use of local cross-validation on EONR to determine the ideal nitrogen level for a given site. This process aims to enhance the accuracy and reliability of EONR estimates, which are crucial for optimizing agricultural yields and minimizing economic costs.

+ explain our proposed model selection method in general (no specific model needs to be mentioned) 

To propose a precise method for accurately predicting the optimal nitrogen rate, our study employed a local EONR model selection approach. To implement this method, we employed spatial clustering splits to partition the dataset into spatial folds consisting of training and testing datasets. Within each spatial fold, we utilized machine learning models to estimate uniform EONRs and subsequently derived local EONRs. We compared the root mean square error (RMSE) of the predicted local EONR values against the local EONR values obtained from a trained Generalized Additive Model (GAM), ranking the models based on their RMSE compared to the GAM model. Moreover, to obtain the true EONR values, we trained ML models on the entire dataset and ranked them based on their RMSE against the actual EONR values. By comparing the rankings of local EONR values and true EONR values, we evaluated the performance of the local EONR model selection. Additionally, to assess the performance of our proposed method against the yield prediction model selection approach, we also conducted model selection based on yield prediction within the spatial folds. The subsequent sections provide a detailed explanation of the steps and procedures involved. 


## ML Model Performance in Site-Specific EONR Estimation with Complete Dataset (stream 1)

The dataset consisting of OFPE data from 500 fields was utilized to estimate the true site-specific EONR values. These values were considered as the estimated true values because the entire dataset was used for both training and testing in the prediction of site-specific EONRs. Later, these estimated values would be compared to the true EONRs, which were calculated as an integral part of the simulation process.

To estimate the true site-specific EONRs, our research employed two distinct approaches for training the machine learning (ML) models: the S-learner approach and the R-learner approach.


To estimate true EONRs using the S-learner, a consistent approach was employed for our candidate ML models, including Random Forest (RF), Boosted Regression Forest (BRF), linear, and Spatial Error (SE) models. This involved training the ML models using the complete dataset. Subsequently, the yield response function associated with each model was estimated using validation data, which encompassed the entire dataset in this context. Profits (${\hat{\pi}}_{im}$) were then computed for each model, and the nitrogen level that maximized profit was determined site specifically within the test dataset.

Suppose we have a set of variables, denoted as $\Omega_i$ ,which represents specific characteristics of the field. Each variable within $\Omega_i$ corresponds to an explanatory feature for a particular location or observation. Let ${\hat{g}}_{im}(N_j,\ \Omega)$ represent a yield response function estimated by one of the candidate ML models, with j representing the  N rates. The estimated yield response function for a specific variable $\Omega_i$ and nitrogen rate  $N_j$ within model m can be denoted as ${\hat{g}}_{im}(N_j,\ \Omega_i)$. To determine the site-specific EONRs we solve the following problem for all variables $\Omega_i$ within each model:

$$
\widehat{N}_i^{o p t}=\underset{N_j}{\operatorname{argmax}}\left(p \cdot \hat{g}_{i m}\left(N_j, \Omega_i\right)-w \cdot N_j\right)
$$

where p and w represent the prices of corn and N respectively. 

To estimate the true site-specific EONRs using the R-learner with a causal forest model, we utilized the entire dataset as the training dataset to predict treatment effects. Nitrogen was considered a factor variable and its application within a given field was categorized into $\alpha$ levels denoted as $(N_\alpha\ ,\ \alpha\ \in{1,\ 2,\ 3,...,l})$. The objective of our analysis was to estimate the changes in yield $(Y)$ resulting from changes in nitrogen rates, specifically from the lowest level $(N_1)$ to the remaining $l-1$ levels ${(N}_\alpha)$, using the validation data (the entire dataset in this context).
We obtained $l-1$ distinct values representing the yield changes caused by varying the nitrogen rate for each observation $\left(\Delta Y_{N_1 \rightarrow N_\alpha}\right)$ in the validation dataset. These yield changes were then treated as the dependent variable, while the nitrogen levels served as the explanatory variables. Subsequently, a GAM was trained for each observation, and yield response function was estimated. The site-specific optimal nitrogen rates were determined by solving the same optimization problem as in the S-learner approach.


There are variations in profit outcomes when estimating true site-specific EONRs using candidate ML models. To determine the profit deficits associated with each model, we establish reference points based on the true optimal yield and true optimal nitrogen levels. These reference values are derived through simulation and serve as benchmarks for comparison.
By contrasting the model-predicted profits with the reference points, we can quantitatively assess the disparities and evaluate the accuracy of the ML models in estimating EONRs. The profit deficit $(∆π)$ can be calculated as follows:

$$
\begin{gathered}
\Delta \pi_i=\hat{\pi}_{i m}-\pi_i \\
\hat{\pi}_{i m}=p \cdot \hat{g}_{i m}\left(N_j, \Omega_i\right)-w \cdot \widehat{N}_{i m}^{o p t} \\
\pi_i=P \cdot Y_i^{o p t}-W \cdot N_i^{o p t}
\end{gathered}
$$

Where ${\hat{\pi}}_{im}$ represents the estimated profit obtained from the ML model $(m)$ for each observation (i), $\pi_i$ represents the true profit, ${\hat{g}}_{im}(N_j,\ \Omega_i)$ represents the estimated yield response function for a specific nitrogen rate $(N_j)$ and other variables $(\Omega_i)$ within the ML model $(m)$, The term $w.{\hat{N}}_{im}^{opt}$ represents the cost of nitrogen application, where $w$ signifies the cost per unit of nitrogen, and ${\hat{N}}_{im}^{opt}$ denotes the estimated optimal nitrogen level within the ML $(m)$. 
In the true profit calculation formula, $Y_i^{opt}$  represents the true optimal yield and $N_i^{opt}$ represents the true variable rate optimal nitrogen. 
In each simulation round we then average profit deficit for each model $(m)$:
$$
\overline{\Delta \pi}_m=\frac{1}{1440} \sum_{i=1}^{1440} \Delta \pi_i
$$
### Ranking the candidate ML models by their RMSE between estimated EONRs and true EONRs

In order to determine the most accurate ML model for estimating site-specific EONRs, we compare the site-specific EONRs estimated by candidate ML models with the true EONRs. 
The evaluation of model performance is carried out using the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) as a metric. Within each simulated round the RMSE of the estimated variable-rate optimal nitrogen for each model (m) is computed using the formula:
$$
R M S E \text { of estimated EONR }=\sqrt[2]{\frac{1}{1440} \sum_{i=1}^{1440}\left(\widehat{N}_{\text {im }}^{\text {opt }}-N_i^{\text {opt }}\right)^2}
$$
In this equation, ${\hat{N}}_{im}^{opt}$ represents the estimated site-specific optimal nitrogen level obtained from the machine learning model (m), while $N_i^{opt}$ represents the true optimal nitrogen level. 
This evaluation metric provides a quantitative measure of the deviation between the estimated EONR and the true EONR. The lower the RMSE value, the closer the estimated EONRs are to the true values, indicating better EONR predictive performance of the model.
After calculating the RMSE of the estimated site-specific EONRs for candidate ML model, the next step involves ranking these models based on these evaluation metrics.

## Model Selection based on Local EONRs (stream 2)

We propose a methodology for model selection based on the estimation of local EONRs values, which involves spatial cross-validation of local EONRs. The rationale behind estimating local EONRs is the absence of observed true site-specific EONRs. Moreover, this approach enhances the accuracy of EONR estimation and improves the generalizability of our model.

The whole data are divided into multiple folds in a spatially clustered manner. Autocorrelated data raises concerns about overfitting. Random sampling for train-test splits or cross-validation violates the assumption of independent and identically distributed (IID) samples. If nearby samples with similar features are included in different sets, the model can make more accurate predictions for those samples.To prevent this, grouping the data by area restricts the model from accessing information it should not have seen.Spatial cross-validation is exemplified as follows:

![f](/Users/mmousavi2/Dropbox/11.jpg){width=80%}
After splitting our dataset (repeatedly) into training and test sets we then performed an analysis to identify the number of overlapping observations and excluded folds and repetitions that exhibited significant similarities. For instance, if we consider 5 folds and 5 repetitions, we initially have 25 splits. However, through our analysis, we identified and removed splits that were too similar to ensure the reliability of our analysis. As a result, we ended up with fewer than 25 splits. This technique enables us to assess the robustness and stability of the obtained clusters.
Within each fold, the test data was employed to train the GAM and estimate the yield response function. Subsequently, uniform EONRs were derived for that particular fold. These EONRs are referred to as the GAM-estimated local EONRs.
For each fold, we trained candidate ML models using the train data. Following that, we estimated site-specific EONRs for the observations in the test data. The estimated local EONRs obtained from both the GAM and the ML models were then compared and ranked using the RMSE metric.


### Estimate Local EONR Using GAM as a Proxy for True EONR

In the absence of true EONRs, we utilize estimated local EONRs derived from GAM as an approximation for the true values. The gam estimated local EONRs provide a reference point against which the performance of candidate ML models can be assessed during the subsequent model selection process. To obtain the GAM local EONRs, we train GAM using the validation data within each clustered split. Subsequently, the yield response function and corresponding profits for a sequence of nitrogen rates are estimated. This allows us to estimate the uniform EONR for each spatial split.

Let ${\hat{g}}_{j\varphi GAM}(N_j)$ represent the yield response function estimated by GAM for the sequence of nitrogen rates $N_j$ at split $\varphi$. In order to estimate gam local EONRs, we solve the following problem for every split $\varphi$:

$$
\widehat{N}_{\varphi\mathrm{GAM}}^{opt}=\underset{N_j}{\operatorname{argmax}}\left(p \cdot \hat{g}_{\mathrm{j} \varphi \mathrm{GAM}}\left(N_j\right)-w \cdot N_j\right)
$$


### Estimate Local EONRs Using the Candidate ML Models

Candidate ML models were trained using the train data specific to each split, denoted as $\varphi$. Following the estimation of yield response function and corresponding profit, the site-specific EONRs were estimated for each observation in the the test data within the split. 
 
Let ${\hat{g}}_{i\varphi m}(N_j,\ \Omega)$ represent the yield response function estimated by model $m$ for the nitrogen rates $N_j$ at split $\varphi$. The estimated yield response function for a specific variable $\Omega_i$ and nitrogen level $N_j$ within the split $\varphi$ and model $m$ can be denoted as ${\hat{g}}_{i\varphi m}(N_j,\ \Omega_i)$. 

We solve the following optimization problem to find site-specific EONRs for each test data and split $\varphi$, and model $m$: 
$$
\widehat{N}_{i \varphi\mathrm{m}}^{o p t}=\underset{N_j}{\operatorname{argmax}}\left(p \cdot \hat{g}_{i \varphi m}\left(N_j, \Omega_i\right)-w \cdot N_j\right)
$$

Then to obtain local EONRs, site-speicfic EONRs were averaged for each split:

$$
\widehat{\mathrm{N}}_{\varphi \mathrm{m}}^{\mathrm{opt}}=\frac{1}{\mathrm{n}} \sum_{i=1}^{\mathrm{n}} \widehat{\mathrm{N}}_{\mathrm{i} \varphi \mathrm{m}}^{\mathrm{opt}}
$$
which $n$ represents te number of observations and in each test data within each split.

### Ranking the ML models by their RMSE between estimated local EONRs and gam estimated local EONRs

In order to assess the performance of candidate ML models $m$, the RMSE between GAM estimated and ML estimated Local EONRs were calculated for each round of simulation:

$$
\text { RMSE of Local EONR Estimated by ML Model vs Local GAM EONR }=\sqrt[2]{\frac{1}\phi \sum_{{\varphi}=1}^\phi\left(\widehat{N}_{\varphi m}^{o p t}-\widehat{\mathrm{N}}_{\varphi \mathrm{GAM}}^{o p t}\right)^2}
$$

The above RMSE metric provides a measure of the dissimilarity between the local EONRs estimated by the ML model $m$ and the gam estimated local EONRs.

We then rank the ML models based on their respective RMSE values of the local EONRs. A lower RMSE indicates a better alignment between the model's estimates and the gam estimates. Thus, we rank the ML models that exhibit lower RMSE values as they demonstrate higher accuracy in predicting the local EONRs.

## Model Selection based on yield prediction ability (Stream 3)

The yield prediction capability is widely employed as a primary criterion for model selection by researchers. In our study, we also evaluate models based on their yield prediction capability and compare its performance with our model selection method in terms of accurately estimating EONRs.

Within each split $(\varphi)$, we employed training data to train candidate ML models except for the causal forest model, which is specifically designed to analyze treatment effects rather than predict yields. Subsequently, we utilized the test data from each split to predict the yield ${\widehat{\ Y}}_{i\varphi m}$.


In each simulation round, candidate ML models were ranked according to their RMSE between the estimated yield, denoted as ${\widehat{\ Y}}_{\varphi m}$, and the true yield ${{\ Y}}_{\varphi }$. The RMSE of the yield was computed using the following formula:

$$
\text { RMSE of Yield predicted by ML Model vs Actual Yield }=\sqrt[2]{\frac{1}{\phi} \sum_{\varphi=1}^\phi\left(\hat{Y}_{\varphi m}^{}-Y_{\varphi}\right)^2}
$$
where  
$$
\begin{aligned}
& \hat{Y}_{\varphi m}^{}=\frac{1}{\mathrm{n}} \sum_{\mathrm{i}=1}^{\mathrm{n}} \widehat{\mathrm{Y}}_{\mathrm{i} \varphi \mathrm{m}} \\
& \mathrm{Y}_{\varphi}=\frac{1}{\mathrm{n}} \sum_{\mathrm{i}=1}^{\mathrm{n}} \mathrm{Y}_{\mathrm{i} \varphi \mathrm{m}}
\end{aligned}
$$

## Comparing the performance of local EONR-based model selection with yield prediction-based model selection


Comparing local EONR-based model selection with yield prediction-based model selection provides insights into their respective effectiveness in selecting suitable models for estimating EONRs.

Our study evaluated the performance of two model selection methods, Local EONR and yield-based criteria, in estimating EONRs. We examined the consistency between the rankings of models selected using these criteria and the rankings based on estimated true EONR. This analysis was conducted for each simulation round, providing insights into the alignment between the model selection methods' rankings and the rankings derived from estimated true EONR across all simulations.

In addition, we calculated the profit loss associated with selecting the best model suggested by our model selection method and the yield-based model selection, compared to the true profit. To determine this, we employed the same approach as discussed in stream 1 of our study.
