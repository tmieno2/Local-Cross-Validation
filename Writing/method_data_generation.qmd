# Method

In this study, Monte Carlo simulations were conducted for nitrogen fertilizer application experiments in corn production. The goal was to assess the effectiveness of two model selection approaches, namely local-EONR and yield, in estimating site-specific EONR. Five hundred synthetic fields were generated, assuming a quadratic-plateau functional form for the true yield response function. This method is crucial for validating the local-EONR and yield selection approaches against the known true data generating process and the site-specific EONR. The analysis considered various models, including Random Forest (RF), Boosted Regression Forest (BRF), linear models, Spatial Error (SE) models, and Causal Forests (CF). A spatial cross-validation method was employed. For the local-EONR approach, each model's effectiveness was assessed based on its ability to predict local uniform EONR for the test data in each fold of the cross-validation process. For the yield selection approach, the effectiveness of each model was evaluated based on its capability to predict yield. After completing these processes for all folds, the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of estimating local EONR and yield was calculated for each model. The model with the lowest average RMSE was chosen as the selected model for each model selection method. The following description details the procedure and components of the simulation analysis. The simulations were conducted using R (R Core Team, 2021), and the relevant programming codes are openly available in the GitHub repository accessible via the following link: https://github.com/tmieno2/Local-Cross-Validation

## Data generation

### Field layout

The experimental setup for the simulated on-farm precision experiment (OFPE) field involved the creation of a grid, where the fundamental spatial unit was a "cell" measuring 6m × 6m. This cell served as the resolution for varying field characteristics data, representing parameters of the "true" yield response function.

While the data resolution was at the 6m × 6m level, the practical monitoring of yields was set at a coarser resolution. The mechanical harvester, assumed to be 18m wide, required harvesting runs of at least 12m to ensure accurate yield data. Consequently, the yield data's resolution became 18m × 12m, forming a "subplot" consisting of 3 cells × 2 cells.

The application of N trial rates used an even larger unit, measuring 18m × 72m (3 cells × 12 cells), referred to as a "plot." This accommodated the variable-rate applicator's application resolution. A 12m "transition zone" was introduced between adjacent plots, allowing the harvester to adapt when the experimental N rate changed. Each N "plot" comprised five effective "subplots" for subsequent data analysis.

The overall dimensions of the field were 432m (72 cells) in width and 864m (144 cells) in length, resulting in a total area of 37.3 hectares. Data from the 6m-long headlands, side-lands (where no transition zones were present on the north and south ends), and 12m-wide "transition zones" were excluded from the analysis. In total, simulated data from 1440 subplots were utilized for data analysis. For identification purposes, the index $j \in{1,\ 2,\ 3,...,1440}$ represented the field's subplots, while the index $i \in{1,\ ...,6}$ denoted the cells within a subplot. The couplet $(j, i)$ was employed to uniquely identify individual cells. 

In our simulation, we assumed that the "true" yield response function for each cell $(j, i)$ followed the quadratic-plateau functional form: 
$$
y_{j, i}=f_{j, i}(N)=f\left(N, c_{j, i}\right)= \begin{cases}\alpha_{j, i}+\beta_{j, i} N+\gamma_{j, i} N^2+\varepsilon_{j, i}, & N<\tau_{j, i} \\ \alpha_{j, i}+\beta_{j, i} \tau_{j, i}+\gamma_{j, i} \tau_{j, i}^2+\varepsilon_{j, i}, & N \geq \tau_{j, i}\end{cases}
$$


The vector $c_{j, i}=\left(\alpha_{j, i}, \beta_{j, i}, \gamma_{j, i}, \tau_{j, i}\right)$ represents the yield response function parameters for each cell $(j, i)$. The parameter $\tau_{j, i}$ signifies the critical N rate at which the yield in cell $(j, i)$ reaches a plateau, indicating that further increases in N rate do not enhance yield. The stochastic error term $\varepsilon_{j, i}$ follows a normal distribution and exhibits spatial autocorrelation.

The quadratic-plateau functional form employed implies a diminishing marginal product of N until a yield plateau is reached. This characteristic is desirable for a yield response function, as highlighted by @frank1990comparison and aligns with patterns commonly observed in agronomic studies.

It's important to note that the cell-specific yield response function $f_{j, i}(N)$ is the reduced form of the meta response function $f$ when the characteristics vector takes on the value $c_{j, i}$. In simpler terms, all soil or field properties influencing yield response to N are encapsulated in the simulated parameters.

The spatial distributions of cell-level parameters $\alpha_{j, i}, \beta_{j, i}, \gamma_{j, i}, \tau_{j, i}$, and the error term  $\varepsilon_{j, i}$ were simulated through Gaussian geostatistical simulation using unconditional random fields. This simulation method, based on specified variograms [@dietrich1996fast; @wood1994simulation], was implemented using the R package gstat [@graler2016spatio]. 

The simulation model adopts a spherical structure with a range of 600 meters and a nugget variance of zero, indicating zero covariance for infinitesimally close observations. The choice of a 600m range was informed by empirical data from eight on-farm randomized N field trials conducted by the Data-Intensive Farm Management Project (DIFM) in 2018 [@bullock2019data]. A higher range value implies increased spatial dependence, reflecting less abrupt differences between production function parameters of neighboring cells.

The mean and sill variance of each parameter were set to achieve a realistic mean yield of 11416 $\mathrm{kg} \mathrm{ha}^{-1}$, and true economically optimal N rates ranged from 113 $\mathrm{kg} \mathrm{ha}^{-1}$ to 273 $\mathrm{kg} \mathrm{ha}^{-1}$ across simulations, aligning with real-world N rate recommendations. The error term $\varepsilon_{j, i}$'s magnitude was determined from empirical data of the DIFM project. Standard deviations of residuals from eight actual trials were used, resulting in a mean value of 1370 $\mathrm{kg} \mathrm{ha}^{-1}$, representing the square root of sill variances for the simulation's error terms.

Distinct spatial patterns of EONR emerged for each of the 500 Monte Carlo iterations, reflecting site-specific parameters and errors. It's noteworthy that while the spatial patterns vary, the parameters of the variogram (nugget and sill) remain consistent across simulations, ensuring uniform spatial dependence of site-specific parameters.

In each simulation, the "true" economically optimal N rate for each cell $(j, i)$ was determined using the expression:
$$
N_{j, i}^* \equiv \operatorname{argmax}_N\left[p \cdot f_{j, i}(N)-w \cdot N\right]
$$
Here, $p$ represents the crop price, $w$ represents the price of nitrogen fertilizer, and $f_{j, i}(N)$ is the yield response function for the specific cell. The goal is to find the value of N that maximizes the expression $p \cdot f_{j, i}(N)-w \cdot N$. 
It's important to note that these true economically optimal N rates $N_{j, i}^* \mathrm{s}$ are not directly observable by producers or researchers.

### Experimental Design

In each simulation of the on-farm experiment, the field layout followed a 4-block $\times$ 2-block grid configuration. Within each block, a 6-plot $\times$ 6-plot grid was established, employing a unique Latin square design. This design ensured that each of the six N rates was assigned to one plot in every row and column of the block.

The Latin square design, incorporating a distinctive pattern [@li2023economic], had the notable feature of preventing adjacent N plots from receiving the same N rate. Moreover, the order of N rates within each row of every block was carefully chosen to minimize abrupt changes in N rates. This consideration accounted for the practical limitations of N application equipment commonly observed in real-world OFPE.

In each simulation, six trial N rates were determined by calculating the $0 \%, 20 \%, 40 \%, 60 \%, 80 \%$, and $100 \%$ quantiles of the true cell-specific plateau N rates ($\tau_{j, i}$). Adjustments were made by subtracting 20 $\mathrm{kg} \mathrm{ha}^{-1}$ from the $0 \%$ quantile and adding 20 $\mathrm{kg} \mathrm{ha}^{-1}$ to the $100 \%$ quantile, ensuring that the trial N rates fully covered the true plateau points. The mean trial N rates across simulations were approximately {80, 130, 154, 184, 219, and 270} $\mathrm{kg} \mathrm{ha}^{-1}$, with negligible differences between simulations. 

### Yield data
In each simulation, the true yield $y_{j, i}$ for each cell $(j, i)$ was generated using the assigned application rate $N_{j, i}$, true response parameters $c_{j, i}=\left(\alpha_{j, i}, \beta_{j, i}, \gamma_{j, i}, \tau_{j, i}\right)$, and the error term $\varepsilon_{j, i}$. This process resulted in a field-level, cell-specific dataset represented as $\left\{\left(y_{j, i}, N_{j, i}\right): j=1, \ldots, 1440 ; i=1, \ldots, 6\right\}$. 

To align with real-world OFPEs, it was assumed that harvesting equipment could accurately record yields only at an 18m $\times$ 12m (subplot) resolution. Given that every cell within a plot received the same N application rate, it follows that $N_{j, 1}=N_{j, 2}=\cdots=N_{j, 6}=N_j$ for each subplot $j$. Letting $\mu_j$ denote the mean of yields for the cells in subplot $j$, the analysis of each round's data was based on 1440 $\left(\mu_j, N_j\right)$ observations.
